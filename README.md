# A tiny calculator with RPN, written on golang

This is my first project on golang, so it is not as serious project as a lang skills practice. Anyway looks like I'll use it anyway in future as universities usually 
makes students to write something like this

This calculator uses it's own lex (unsupportable peace of function, anyway better than regexps) and Reverse Polish Notation (you can find infix to postfix expressions converter 
in polishNotation package

Functions and unary operators aren't supported
